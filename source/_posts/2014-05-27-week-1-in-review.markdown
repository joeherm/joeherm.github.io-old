I had quite a bit of fun during my first week in the Bay.  [Work](http://www.saymedia.com/) was chill, and it looks I'm going to have some interesting coding challenges with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) this summer.  Enough about work!  Here's a quick summary of the my super touristy Memorial day weekend.

Saturday evening I took the Caltrain down to Stanford to party with the future roomie.  Good times were had.  The campus itself really blew me away.  The quality, scale, and consistency of the architecture is justification enough for any visit to their campus.

I spent Sunday morning exploring a little more of Stanford's truly serene campus.  After I got home, I went out to eat with my cousin Tracy and her fiancé JP.  Sadly, I didn't snap any pictures, but I did eat some [delicious tacos](http://www.yelp.com/biz/papito-west-san-francisco-3) and tried [Smitten Ice Cream](http://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-3)  over in Hayes Valley (pro-tip: try the Strawberry Balsamic flavor).

After sleeping in on Monday, I woke up and bought a bike.  I bought a single-speed because it was cheap.  I biked from Fisherman's wharf to, but not across, the Golden Gate Bridge.

As I biked from the bridge back to my place in NoPa I realized a few things:

1.  San Francisco's hills are no joke.
2.  I am out of shape.
3.  A single-speed bike is no way to bike these hills for someone who is it out of shape.

As a result of this embarassingly strenuous effort, I ordered some pretty good pizza from [Little Star Pizza](http://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-san-francisco).  Based on the yelp reviews, I think it might be a little overrated... but that didn't stop me from immediately eating half of it.

It was a nice introductory weekend to the city, and it's shaping up to be a fun summer.

###DOPE FIND OF THE WEEK###
[The café](http://www.yelp.com/biz/oasis-cafe-san-francisco-3) kitty corner from me serves Ethiopian food.  *Mmmmmmmm*, Sambusa!
