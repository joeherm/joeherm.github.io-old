###Listenings

+ [Your Old Droog Kills The 5 Fingers Of Death with Ease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZZO9EueT4s)
    > Like a dentyne ice packet \ poppin' off of the gums \ I'd rather look broke in the burbs \ than be fresh in the slums

    > Back in the line of fire \ saying my style's dated is like checking to see if wine expired
+ ["A Remark You Made"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boNCY0Ai44M)

###Viewings
+ [Skyfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyfall)- Excellent film, would be worth analyzing its imperalist & statist themes
