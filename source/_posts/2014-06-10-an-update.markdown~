What have I been up to?  Working, [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9251989-joe), cooking, [attending corporate-ass festivals](http://chipotlecultivate.com/), [chilling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Park), etc.  Oh, I also ate some [dope ramen](http://lavasf.com/) yesterday.
