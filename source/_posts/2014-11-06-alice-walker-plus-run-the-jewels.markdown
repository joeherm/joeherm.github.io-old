Yesterday was November 5th. Every year since I've started critically thinking about politics, the day has been a day of disillusionment for me- regardless of what party takes office.  That's why I'm grateful that I got to see [Alice Walker give a lecture at Hill Auditorium](http://www.michigandaily.com/news/alice-walker-speaks-campus-after-being-disinvited-last-year).  Although more inspirational than practical, it was a boost to the spirits to see someone with so much political and life experience maintain hope, compassion, and a wonderful sense of humor through years of struggle.

The new Run the Jewels album has also provided an outlet for me to channel some political frustration and anger.  In the song *Lie, Cheat, Steal* off RTJ2, Killer Mike asks the hard-hitting questions:

> Like who really run this?

> Like who really run that man that say he run this?

> Who who really run that man that say he run this, run run run run this?"
