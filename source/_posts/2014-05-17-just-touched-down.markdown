I touched down at the San Francisco International Airport at around 6 PM PST.  My summer in the Bay has begun.  After a far too expensive taxi ride, I picked up the keys to my place in NoPa.  The neighborhood seems really active and there are a ton of things to do within walking distance.  My landlord happens to own a party store less than a block from my doorstep, so the big win of today (besides getting here) is the revelation of accesible, discounted microbrews.  I'm also less than a 5 minute walk from Alamo Square park, so I was obliged to take a picture of the [Painted ladies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies).

As you can see, some of these fine ladies are currently under construction.  After this brief walking tour of the immediate area, I lazily called it a day... but not before grabbing a chicken burrito from the conveniently located [El Rancho Grande](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-rancho-grande-san-francisco).

Yummy, reasonably priced Mexican food?  It's safe to say I'll be back.  [Bay to Breakers](http://www.baytobreakers.com/) will have runners come through the area tomorrow, so it should be party around these parts.
