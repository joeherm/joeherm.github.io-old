It's been a while since I've updated this blog.  The school year has started back up after finishing a good summer in San Francsico.  Going forward I'll be trying to take the effort of blogging a little more seriously, hopefully delivering some interesting content on literature, technology, philosophy, etcetera.  In the spirit of starting fall in Ann Arbor, here's a wonderful poem from poet Donald Hall:

> Kicking the leaves, October, as we walk home together
> from the game, in Ann Arbor,
> on a day the color of soot, rain in the air;
> I kick at the leaves of maples,
> reds of seventy different shades, yellow
> like old paper; and poplar leaves, fragile and pale;
> and elm leaves, flags of a doomed race.
> I kick at the leaves, making a sound I remember
> as the leaves swirl upward from my boot,
> and flutter; and I remember
> Octobers walking to school in Connecticut,
> wearing corduroy knockers that swished
> with a sound like leaves; and a Sunday buying
> a cup of cider at a roadside stand
> on a dirt road in New Hampshire; and kicking the leaves,
> autumn 1955 in Massachusetts, knowing
> my father would die when the leaves were gone.

Excerpt from the poem <i>[Kicking the Leaves](http://www.wildriverreview.com/2/2-poetry_kicking.html)</i> by [Donald Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Hall).
