I recently came across a very interesting article on *Jacobin* entitled ["Literature is Liberalism."](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/10/literature-is-liberalism/)  The article suggests that the Nobel Prize in Literature is a political tool that hides its politics under the guise of a humanist universality.  The commitee is "engaged in constructing what constitutes the literary, and then working to universalize that construction."  This construction, as the author points out, rises out specific historical conditions that are necessarily political.  The following two paragraphs summarize the key idea:

> In the idealist mode that the Nobel committee supports, literature is an expression 
> of humanistic liberalism, in which the genius writer, possessed of unique visionary 
> abilities, examines the world from the outside, determines its realities, and
> presents them for our contemplation as art.

> The alternative approach — and the approach that itself allows us to understand the 
> Nobel’s position — is a materialist one that perceives art as principally shaped by 
> the circumstances in which it emerges. Even literature that understands itself as 
> apolitical is enmeshed in conflict and riddled with contradictions. The position of 
> distant observation is not art’s natural purpose; it is a specific disposition that 
> has been valorized for particular reasons.

As a lover of "classic literature," this article hit close to home and made some extremely valid critiques of the prize that I had not considered.  It is a reminder that literature and art, like all things, rise out of material conditions that cannot be removed from political and historical context.  Prize committees uphold aesthetics that reflect and reinforce the politics of the committee itself.  Certainly the Nobel Prize for Literature is no different.
