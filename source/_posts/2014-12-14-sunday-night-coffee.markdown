I've decided to post a "Sunday Night Coffee" every Sunday as a means of cataloging the cultural/intellectual/work "artifacts" that are captivating in a given week.  It seems like an interesting project to track how my thoughts and interests develop.  I didn't write last week due to finals, but hopefully I can manage to write consistently now that things have slowed down.  Below is the content that I've found interesting since I last wrote.

###Readings
+ Currently reading: *Steady Work* by Irving Howe, *The Art of Drowning* by Billy Collins
+ [*Post Office*](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/323413952) by Charles Bukowski
+ ["Reactionaries in Space"](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/12/interstellar-review/) by Eileen Jones
+ ["Mexico On the Brink"](http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/mexico-on-the-brink-pri-ayotzinapa) by Benjamin T. Smith- A great overview of the current unrest in Mexico and the sociopolitical conditions from which it emerged.
+ ["What If Atheists Were Defined By Their Actions?"](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2014/12/08/369356881/what-if-atheists-were-defined-by-their-actions) by Tania Lombrozo- An interesting, but ultimately messy article on atheism.

###Listenings
+ [Straight No Chaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzI4MtoTfAw)
+ [PRhyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPy5mGgQVU)

###Películas
+ [Qué tan lejos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9_tan_lejos)- Surprisingly enjoyable given the weakness of the ploy.
+ [Y tu mamá también](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Tu_Mam%C3%A1_Tambi%C3%A9n)- Excellent.
+ [Los viajes del viento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Journeys)- One of the slowest movies I've seen in a while, but the magical realism is a nice touch.
+ [Ocho apellidos vascos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocho_apellidos_vascos)- 2/5.

###Baking
+ [Banana Bread](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/banana-bread-recipe.html)
