Admittedly, I didn't do anything interesting today.  I woke up and explored a little more of the NoPa area, expanding my knowledge of my immediate surroundings.  The Victorian architecture and rolling hills hold a strong allure after so many years spent in the Midwest.  As I mentioned in the previous post, today was the Bay to Breakers run.  The alcohol was flowing and there were countless people dressed in crazy costumes (Ã  la Mardi Gras).

Later, I went to the Japantown Mall and bought [cheap plastic goods](http://www.yelp.com/biz/daiso-japan-san-francisco-3) to help organize my room.  I topped off this trip by eating some subpar Wonton soup in the mall food court.  I wasted away the rest of the day, but I'm excited to start work tomorrow and see what challenges the summer has in store.
