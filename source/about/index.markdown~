What's good?  I'm Joe Hermann, an undergraduate studying computer science and Spanish at the [University of Michigan].  Technology fascinates me,and I want to be able to use it to [build new and exicting things].  I like other things too!  I'm passionate about [hip hop music and culture], [books], and drinking tea (among other things).  Feel free to add me on [facebook], or send me an [email].
