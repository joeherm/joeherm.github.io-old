    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was November 5th. Every year since I&rsquo;ve started critically thinking about politics, the day has been a day of disillusionment for me- regardless of what party takes office.  That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m grateful that I got to see <a href="http://www.michigandaily.com/news/alice-walker-speaks-campus-after-being-disinvited-last-year">Alice Walker give a lecture at Hill Auditorium</a>.  Although more inspirational than practical, it was a boost to the spirits to see someone with so much political and life experience maintain hope, compassion, and a wonderful sense of humor through years of struggle.</p>

<p>The new Run the Jewels album has also provided an outlet for me to channel some political frustration and anger.  In the song <em>Lie, Cheat, Steal</em> off RTJ2, Killer Mike asks the hard-hitting questions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Like who really run this?</p>

<p>Like who really run that man that say he run this?</p>

<p>Who who really run that man that say he run this, run run run run this?"</p></blockquote>
