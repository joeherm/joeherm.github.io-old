    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I touched down at the San Francisco International Airport at around 6 PM PST.  My summer in the Bay has begun.  After a far too expensive taxi ride, I picked up the keys to my place in NoPa.  The neighborhood seems really active and there are a ton of things to do within walking distance.  My landlord happens to own a party store less than a block from my doorstep, so the big win of today (besides getting here) is the revelation of accesible, discounted microbrews.  I&rsquo;m also less than a 5 minute walk from Alamo Square park, so I was obliged to take a picture of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies">Painted ladies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=painted+ladies,+San+Francisco,+CA&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.776295,-122.432778&amp;spn=0.009718,0.021136&amp;sll=37.784666,-122.431113&amp;sspn=0.009785,0.021136&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/xlhL1yd.jpg" title="Painted ladies" ></a></p>

<p>As you can see, some of these fine ladies are currently under construction.  After this brief walking tour of the immediate area, I lazily called it a day&hellip; but not before grabbing a chicken burrito from the conveniently located <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-rancho-grande-san-francisco">El Rancho Grande</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/2E2xDtb.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/2E2xDtb.jpg</a>" width="400" height="534" title="Burrito" ></p>

<p>Yummy, reasonably priced Mexican food?  It&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;ll be back.  <a href="http://www.baytobreakers.com/">Bay to Breakers</a> will have runners come through the area tomorrow, so it should be party around these parts.</p>
